# Gunning Fog Index Calculator for Software Documentation

## Overview
This project provides a Java-based tool for calculating the Gunning Fog Index of software documentation. The Gunning Fog Index is a readability test that estimates the years of formal education or the minimum age a full-time student needs to understand a text on the first reading. This tool is specifically tailored to analyze the readability of software-related documents, making it an essential utility for technical writers, software developers, and project managers.

## Features
- Read text files containing software documentation.
- Calculate the Gunning Fog Index to assess readability.
- Handle various types of software documentation, from user guides to technical API documents.

## Getting Started
